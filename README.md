# 🩸 TeamRedHead's Dirty Stash

> “If you’re reading this, you’re already compromised.”
 
This ain't your average repo.  
No guides. No structure. No rules.  

---

## 🩻 Payloads?  
**PHP. ASPX. Dirt. Malware-grade toys.**  
Everything we wouldn’t run in prod... unless we owned the prod. 😉

They reverse shells.  
They upload stuff.  
They eval, exfil, and execute like it’s 1999.  
Obfuscated? Sometimes.  
Loud? Maybe.  
Effective? Always.

---

## 🧨 Use-cases

- Drop it on that forgotten uploads folder.  
- Smuggle it through a dumb firewall.  
- Obfuscate it, encode it, rename it to `invoice.php`.  
- Launch. Pivot. Profit.

## 🪓 TeamRedHead

We break. We build. We burn logs.  
We're not here to impress — we’re here to **persist**.

You don’t *join* TeamRedHead.  
You wake up and realize you were **always part of it**.

## ☠️ Legal Junk

This repo is for **educational/research purposes**...  
...and for when your inner voice whispers:  
> *“Just one shell won’t hurt.”*

Use responsibly — or irresponsibly — just don’t cry when `/` vanishes.  

---

**NO WARRANTY. NO SUPPORT. NO MORALS.**

Run it like it’s stolen.  
Welcome to the 🐍 pit.

**TeamRedHead out.**
